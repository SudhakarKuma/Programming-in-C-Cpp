# Pointers in C/C++
The code used here are adapted from the tutorials on pointers offered by [mycodeschool](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClEEsT7DkdVO_fkrBw0OTrA). Following concepts have been included in the code files:

* Pointer types, pointer arithmetic, void pointers
* Pointers to Pointers in C/C++
* Pointers as function arguments - call by reference
* Character arrays and pointers
* Pointers and multidimensional arrays
* Dynamic memory allocation in C - malloc calloc realloc free
