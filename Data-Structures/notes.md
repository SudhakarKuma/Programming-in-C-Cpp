* Data structure: It is a way to store and organize data in a computer so that the data can be used efficiently. 

* Abstract data type (ADT): These are entities that are definitions of data and operation but do not have implementations. So they do not have any implementation details. 

* The use of array as dynamic list is not efficient in terms of memory.

* Stack as an ADT:  A list with the restriction that insertion and deletion can be performed only from one end, called the top. A stack is called **Last-in-First-Out** (LIFO) structure. Following are the operations available with a stack: 
 
  * Push: Inserting an element on top of the stack 
  * Pop: Removing an element from the stack 
  * Top: Returns the element at the top of the stack 
  * IsEmpty: Returns `True` if the stack is empty 

* Applications of stack:
 
  * Functions calls/ Recursion: Stack data structure is used for execution of function calls in a program. 
  * Undo in an editor
  * Balanced parentheses
